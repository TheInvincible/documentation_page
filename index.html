			<h2 id="intro">Introduction to Python</h2>

			<p>Python is a high level general-purpose programming language. It uses a multi-paradigm approach, meaning
				it supports procedural, object-oriented, and some functional programming constructs.<br /><br />It was
				created by Guido van Rossum as a successor to another language (called ABC) between 1985 and 1990, and
				is currently used on a large array of domains like web development, desktop applications, data science,
				DevOps, and automation/productivity.</p>

			<h2 id="install-python">Installing Python</h2>


			<p>If you’re running Linux or Mac OS at home, you may already have Python 3, too. Mac and Linux
				distributions may include an outdated version of Python (Python 2), but you should install an updated
				one (Python 3). You can simply follow the instructions <a
					href="https://docs.python-guide.org/starting/install3/linux/">here</a> if you're an ubuntu user and
				<a href="https://docs.python-guide.org/starting/install3/osx/">here</a> if you are a Mac OS user.

			<p>Microsoft Windows does not come with any version of Python but don’t despair! You can point-and-click
				your way through <a href="https://www.python.org/downloads/windows/"> installing Python</a>, regardless
				of what operating system you have.</p>

			<h2 id="first-program">Writing your first Python Program</h2>

			<p>To write a python program, you can use the python shell, your terminal or a text editor. <br /><br />
				To run the python shell, simply go to your terminal and type <code>python3</code> or simply
				<code>python</code> for windows users</p>

			<p>Now that we've seen how to run the python shell, we can go ahead and write our first python program
				<br><code class="highlight">print('Hello World!')</code><br /> There! you just wrote your first python
				program</p>

			<h2 id="data-types">Python Data Types</h2>

			<p>Now you know how to interact with the Python interpreter and execute Python code. It’s time to dig into
				the Python language. First up is a discussion of the basic data types that are built into Python. These
				are Integers, Strings, Floats or floating point numbers and Booleans</p>

			<p><strong>Integers</strong> are what, in layman terms be called numbers e.g 1 is an integer, 32 is an
				integer and so on. An integer type in python is called <code>int</code><br /><strong>Strings</strong>
				are sequences of character data. The string type in Python is called <code>str</code>. String literals
				may be delimited using either single or double quotes. An Example of a string literal is our first
				python program 'Hello World!'.<br /><strong>Floats or floating point numbers</strong> are specified with
				a decimal point e.g. 4.5 is a float.</p>

			<h2 id="data-structures">Data Structures</h2>

			<p>Data structures are a way of organizing and storing data so that they can be accessed and worked with
				efficiently. They define the relationship between the data, and the operations that can be performed on
				the data. They include Lists, Tuples, Arrays, Sets, Dictionaries, Files</p>


			<p>The most commonly used non-primitive data-types are Lists. Lists in Python are used to store collection
				of heterogeneous items. These are mutable, which means that you can change their content without
				changing their identity. You can recognize lists by their square brackets [ and ] that hold elements,
				separated by a comma ,. Below are two lists, one of numbers and another of strings
				<pre><code class="highlight">list_num = [1,2,45,6,7,2,90,23,435] 
list_char = ['c','o','o','k','i','e']</code></pre>

				Lists are built into Python: you do not need to invoke them separately.
				<br /> <br />
				Another quite versatile data-structure is called an array. An Array is a container which can hold a fix
				number of items and these items should be of the same type. Most of the data structures make use of
				arrays to implement their algorithms for example, we can treat lists as arrays. e.g
				<code class="highlight">
						a = [1, 3.5, "Hello"] 
					</code>
				<br />
				We then import the array module. <code>import array as arr </code>
				<br />
				<pre><code class="highlight">a = arr.array('i', [1, 2, 3])
print ("The new created array is : ", end =" ") 
	for i in range (0, 3): 
	    print (a[i], end =" ") 
	print()	</code></pre>

			<h2 id="regular">Modules</h2>
			<p>A module is a file containing Python definitions and statements. The file name is the module name with
				the suffix .py appended. Within a module, the module’s name (as a string) is available as the value of
				the global variable __name__. For instance, use your favorite text editor to create a file called
				fibo.py in the current directory with the following contents:

				<pre>
						<code class="highlight"> #Fibonacci numbers module

def fib(n):    # write Fibonacci series up to n
    a, b = 0, 1
    while a < n:
        print(a, end=' ')
        a, b = b, a+b
    print()

def fib2(n):   # return Fibonacci series up to n
    result = []
    a, b = 0, 1
    while a < n
        result.append(a)
        a, b = b, a+b
	return result
</code>
